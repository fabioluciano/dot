# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io), targeting
**macOS** (Homebrew) and **Arch Linux** (pacman/yay).

## Bootstrap

On a fresh machine (installs chezmoi, pulls this repo, and applies it):

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply fabioluciano
```

Or, if chezmoi is already installed:

```sh
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/fabioluciano/dot.git
```

### Prerequisites

- A Bitwarden vault unlocked via the `bw` CLI (`bw login && bw unlock`) — used
  to populate tokens/API keys in `~/.zshenv`. The expected item is named
  `dotfiles-tokens`.
- A YubiKey for GPG/SSH commit signing (the `run_before_*` scripts derive the
  public key and `allowed_signers`; signing degrades gracefully if absent).

## What's managed

| Manifest        | Target            | Installed by                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `dot_Brewfile.tmpl`| `~/.Brewfile`  | `brew bundle --global` (macOS)                 |
| `dot_Pacmanfile`| `~/.Pacmanfile`   | `yay`/`paru`/`pacman -S --needed` (Arch)       |
| `dot_Krewfile`  | `~/.Krewfile`     | `kubectl krew install` (kubectl plugins)       |
| mise            | `~/.config/mise`  | `mise install`                                 |

Package installs run automatically on `chezmoi apply` via the
`run_onchange_after_*` scripts in `.chezmoiscripts/` — they re-run only when the
corresponding manifest changes (tracked by its content hash).

## Day-to-day

```sh
chezmoi edit <file>     # edit a source file in $EDITOR
chezmoi diff            # preview pending changes
chezmoi apply           # apply (and run package sync if a manifest changed)
chezmoi update          # pull latest from the repo and apply
topgrade                # update everything (system, brew, mise, plugins, …)
```

## Layout

- `dot_zshrc.tmpl`, `private_dot_zshenv.tmpl`, `dot_zsh_plugins*.txt.tmpl` — zsh
  (antidote static bundle, cached completions, lazy tool init).
- `private_dot_config/` — app configs (nvim/AstroNvim, tmux, ghostty, k9s, jj,
  starship, mise, aerospace, espanso, …).
- `private_dot_config/git/`, `private_dot_gnupg/`, `private_dot_ssh/` — git
  identity + SSH-based commit signing via YubiKey.
- `.chezmoiscripts/` — `run_before_*` (YubiKey key material) and
  `run_onchange_after_*` (package sync).

## System Dependencies

These must be present **before** `chezmoi init --apply` will succeed:

| Dependency | Why | macOS | Arch |
|---|---|---|---|
| **chezmoi** (>=2.47) | dotfile manager itself | `brew install chezmoi` | `pacman -S chezmoi` |
| **git** | pulls the source repo | included with Xcode CLI tools | `pacman -S git` |
| **bitwarden-cli** (`bw`) | unlocks `dotfiles-tokens` vault to populate `~/.zshenv` | `brew install bitwarden-cli` | `pacman -S bitwarden-cli` |
| **mise** | installs Node/Python/etc per-project | `brew install mise` | `pacman -S mise` |
| **Homebrew** (macOS) | manages ~170 formulae + casks | already on system | n/a |
| **pacman/yay** (Arch) | manages ~200 packages | n/a | `pacman -S yay` or `paru` |
| **antidote** | zsh plugin manager (fetched by `.chezmoiexternal.toml`) | cloned automatically | cloned automatically |
| **krew** | kubectl plugin manager (`dot_Krewfile`) | `brew install krew` | `pacman -S krew-bin` |

Optional but expected: a **YubiKey** for GPG/SSH commit signing. The
`run_before_*` scripts derive the public key and `allowed_signers`; signing
degrades gracefully if absent.

## Troubleshooting

**Preview before applying:**

```sh
chezmoi diff            # show exactly what would change
chezmoi --dry-run apply # apply without touching anything
```

**chezmoi doctor** catches most misconfigurations (missing git, broken templates,
stale cache):

```sh
chezmoi doctor
```

**Bitwarden vault locked** — the `run_onchange_after_*` scripts call `bw` to
fetch tokens. If the vault is locked, you'll see `bw get` failures:

```sh
bw login
bw unlock          # unlock the vault, then re-run:
chezmoi apply
```

**Template render errors** — if a `.tmpl` file references a missing data key
(defined in `.chezmoidata.yaml`), chezmoi will fail with a template error.
Debug with:

```sh
chezmoi execute-template < dot_zshenv.tmpl
```

**antidote not refreshing** — `.chezmoiexternal.toml` sets a 168-hour refresh.
Force an immediate update:

```sh
chezmoi --refresh-externals apply
```

## Rollback

`chezmoi apply` is idempotent. The source directory is the source of truth; the
target files are derived from it. To undo a change:

1. **Inspect what changed:**

   ```sh
   chezmoi diff
   ```

2. **Revert in the source directory:**

   ```sh
   # undo the last commit
   git -C "$(chezmoi source-dir)" revert HEAD

   # or checkout a specific file
   git -C "$(chezmoi source-dir)" checkout HEAD -- <path>
   ```

3. **Re-apply from the reverted source:**

   ```sh
   chezmoi apply
   ```

Because `chezmoi apply` re-syncs from source, reverting a commit and applying
restores the previous state. The `--dry-run` flag lets you verify the rollback
before committing.

**Note:** Package installs (brew/pacman) are not automatically undone by
reverting a dotfile commit. If you added a formula and want to remove it,
edit `dot_Brewfile.tmpl`/`dot_Pacmanfile` and run `chezmoi apply` again.

## Switching opencode provider (`oc-provider`)

The `oc-provider` command switches all opencode agents to use a specific LLM
provider in one shot:

```sh
oc-provider bedrock-claude # switch to the canonical Bedrock Claude chain
oc-provider bedrock-mixed  # switch to the mixed non-Anthropic Bedrock chain
oc-provider opencode    # switch to OpenCode Zen (opencode/ models)
oc-provider opencode-free # switch to free OpenCode Zen models
oc-provider github-copilot # switch to GitHub Copilot Plus models
oc-provider xiaomi      # switch to Xiaomi (mimo)
oc-provider opencode recommended # switch with Oh My OpenAgent recommended tiers
oc-provider github-copilot ultra # GitHub Copilot with lowest safe reasoning variants
```

**How it works:**

1. Writes the chosen provider name to `~/.config/opencode/.active_provider`.
2. Runs `chezmoi apply` to re-render `oh-my-openagent.json` from its template,
   which reads `.active_provider` as the single source of truth (default: `xiaomi`)
   when the file is absent).
3. Each provider entry in the matrix specifies which model, API endpoint, and
   auth mechanism opencode uses for that provider.

**Fallback behavior:** opencode is configured with automatic intra-provider fallback
between tiers (pro → fast → cheap) when the primary model is unavailable
(rate-limited, throttled, etc.). Fallback stays within the active provider —
it never crosses to a different provider. The tier matrix in `.chezmoidata/opencode_providers.toml`
controls the model for each tier.

**Profiles:** pass an optional profile as the second argument. `moderate` is the
default, `optimized`/`super` trade quality for cost, and `recommended` applies
the Oh My OpenAgent recommended effort/variant tiers per role where the active
provider supports them.
`ultra` minimizes cost further by selecting the lowest safe reasoning variant
for each provider/model family and leaving unsupported cases for the provider
runtime default.

**Verify current provider:**

```sh
cat ~/.config/opencode/.active_provider
chezmoi execute-template < private_dot_config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc.tmpl
```

The `oc-provider` command is part of the opencode tap installed via Homebrew
(`anomalyco/tap/opencode`). On Arch, it's managed alongside the opencode
package.

## Managing opencode skills

opencode skills are **not** tracked by chezmoi. They are managed exclusively by the [`skills` CLI](https://skills.sh) and installed directly to `~/.config/opencode/skills/`.

opencode discovers skills automatically at startup — no config entry needed.

### Install a skill

```sh
# Find skills
npx skills find <query>

# Install from a GitHub repo (global, for opencode)
npx skills add <owner/repo> -a opencode -g

# Example: install community DevOps skills
npx skills add Raishin/vanguard-frontier-agentic -a opencode -g
```

### Manage installed skills

```sh
npx skills list                        # list installed skills
npx skills update -g                   # update all global skills
npx skills remove <skill> -a opencode  # remove a specific skill
```

### Why not chezmoi?

Skills are community-maintained and updated frequently. Tracking them in chezmoi would require manual commits on every update. The `skills` CLI handles versioning and updates independently.
